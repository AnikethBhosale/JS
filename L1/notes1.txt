1. console.log('some txt') --> is used to log(print) a msg to the console

2. ;  --> full stop of lone of code

3. connect js with html --> use <script src="path/of/js"></script>

4. JS is dynamically typed , we need not tell what type of data is going to be stored in a variable

5. VARIABLE RULES :
  --> Variable names are case sensitive ; 'a' & 'A' is different.
  --> Only  letters , digits, underscore(_) and $ is allowed. (not even space)
  --> Only a letter , underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character.
  --> Reserved words cannot be variable names.

6. Three choices to declare variables -> var , let , const 

7. 
 -->var : Variable can be re-decalred and updated . Global scope variable. (used only till 2015 , until we got ES6)
 -->let : Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable/
 -->const : Variable cannot be re-declared aor updated. A block dscope variable.


8. Data Types in JS : Number ,  String , Boolean , Undefined , Null , BigInt , Symbol.

9. Data Types: ( function to find type of data --> typeof(data) [typeof(null)='object'] )
  --> Primitive Data Types (7 types)

  -->Non - Primitive Data Types (like objects) [arrays,functions] == colection of values.
