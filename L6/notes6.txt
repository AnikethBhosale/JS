1. DOM (Document Object Model) PART 1 :
  
  1. Three Musketeers of Web Dev :
    --> HTML (Structure)
    --> CSS  (Style)
    --> JS   (Logic)


  2. Starter Code :
    --> <style> tag connects HTML and CSS
    --> <script> tag connects HTML and JS 

    --> Uses :
      --> Readability
      --> Modularity
      --> Browser caching (faster page loading)


  3. Window Object :
    --> The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is browser's object (not JavaScript's) & is automatically created by browser.

    --> It is a global object with lot's of properties and methods. 

    --> Automatically used by JS and it's code , eg: alert("hello!!!) == window.alert("hello!!!)


  4. What is DOM ? :
    --> When a web page is loaded , the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.

    --> See FIG1 - DOM 

    --> All the HTML code that is attached to JS , can be access from woth JS.

    --> All the HTML code is stored in JS as a object named Document.

    --> In Window object , Document object (a sub-object) is created.

    --> Can be viewed from console , window-> document ; docment-> all (for tags used in html)

    --> Can also use window.document in console to print entire html code.

    --> For mathod/properties of document :
      -> console.dir(window.docment)

    --> For code we can also use :
      -> console.log(window.docment) 

    --> DOM :
      ->Document : Name of Object
      ->Object   : Because all are objects
      ->Model    : We made a model of HTML code (Tree like Structure starting from window ; see FIG1 ; every component window,document,html,etc are called "nodes" )

    --> As window is global object , we can use docment directly.

    --> All this information that we get from DOM is useful when you need to dynamically change properties of HTML.
      -> eg : Change background color :
        -> document.body.style.background = "green"; will change background color in browser at runtime without changing HTML at the server .

  NOTE : If you load JS in HTML before <body> tag then DOM elements are not accessible . Thus, always write <script> tag just before ending the </body> tag .


  5. DOM Manipulation :
    1. Selecting with id :
      --> document.getElementById("myid");  // single -> element

      --> Id in HTML should be unique , if multiple tags have same ID , then "getElementById" will select first occurance of ID   

    2. Selecting with Class (selects every tag with same class) :
      --> document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");  // multiple -> elements 

    3. Selecting with tag :
      -> document.getElementsByTagName("p"); // multiple -> elements

    4. Query Selector : 
      --> 49:00
