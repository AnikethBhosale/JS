    --> CSS  (Style)
    --> JS   (Logic)


  2. Starter Code :

    --> <script> tag connects HTML and JS 

    --> Uses :
      --> Readability
      --> Modularity
      --> Browser caching (faster page loading)


  3. Window Object :
    --> The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is browser's object (not JavaScript's) & is automatically created by browser.

    --> It is a global object with lot's of properties and methods.
