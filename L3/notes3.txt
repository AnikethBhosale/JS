1. Loops in JS :
  --> Loops are used to execute a pieceof code again and again.

  1. for loop :
    --> for (let i =1 ; i<=5;i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }


  2. infinite loop :
    --> A loop that never ends. 
    --> Stoping condition always true

  3. while loop :
    --> while(condition){
      // do some work
    }

    --> Usually we do the initialization before while and updation within while block
