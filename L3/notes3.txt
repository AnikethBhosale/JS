1. Loops in JS :
  --> Loops are used to execute a pieceof code again and again.

  1. for loop :
    --> for (let i =1 ; i<=5;i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }


  2. infinite loop :
    --> A loop that never ends. 
    --> Stoping condition always true

  3. while loop :
    --> while(condition){
      // do some work
    }

    --> Usually we do the initialization before while and updation within while block

  4.do-while loop :
    --> do{
      //do some work
    }while(condition);//executes at least once

  5.for-of loop :
    --> helps in iterating arrays and strings
    for(let val of strVar){
      //do some work
    }

  6.for-in loop :
    --> used for iterating through objects and arrays
    for(let key in objVar){
      //do some work
    }
