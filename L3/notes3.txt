1. Loops in JS :
  --> Loops are used to execute a pieceof code again and again.

  1. for loop :
    --> for (let i =1 ; i<=5;i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }


  2. infinite loop : 
    --> A loop that never ends. 
    --> Stoping condition always true

  3. while loop :
    --> while(condition){
      // do some work
    }

    --> Usually we do the initialization before while and updation within while block

  4.do-while loop :
    --> do{
      //do some work
    }while(condition);//executes at least once

  5.for-of loop :
    --> helps in iterating arrays and strings
    for(let val of strVar){
      //do some work
    }

  6.for-in loop :
    --> used for iterating through objects and arrays
    for(let key in objVar){
      //do some work
    }


2. Strings in JS :
--> String is a sequence of characters used to represent text
--> Strings have in-built properties and in-built fnctions(methods)

  -->Properties
    --> Every string has it's own internal variable which store some value about the string (eg:lenght)
    -->We see that the string is bahaving like object (because str.length ,etc (.) to know values stored in internal variable)
    --> Indices start from 0 (Index -> Singular)

  1.Create a string :
    --> let str = "Aniketh";
    
  2.String Length :
    --> str.length ;
    
  3.String indices :
    -->str[0],str[1],str[2]


3. Template Literals in JS :
--> A way to have embedded expressions in strings.
  --> To create strings by doing substitution of placeholders
  'string text ${expression} string text`

--> It is also called string interpolation.


4. Escape characters:
**Note : If there is a string "Aniketh\nBhosale" --> though it has 16 characters , the length will be 15 as escape characters are considered as a single character.
--> \n -> new line
--> \t -> a tab


5.String Method in JS:
--> These are built-in functions to manipulate a string.
--> let str = "  Text Text    ";
  --> str.toUpperCase();
  --> str.toLowerCase();
  --> str.trim();//removes whitespaces --> extra spaces from beginning and end
  -->str.slice(start,end?);//end is optional and non-inclusive
  -->str1.concat(str2);
  -->str.replace(searchVal, newVal);
  -->str.charAt(idx);

**Note: Strings are immutable
